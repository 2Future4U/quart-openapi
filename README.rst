SwagGen
=======

SwagGen is an extension for `Quart`_ that adds support for generating a swagger.json file using openapi 3.0.
If you are familiar with Quart, this just wraps around it to add a swagger.json route similar to `Flask-RESTPlus`_
and adds a Resource base class for building RESTful APIs.

Compatibility
=============

SwagGen requires Python 3.4+

Installation
============

You can install via pip

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install fds.swaggen
